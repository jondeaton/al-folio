### USA Junior National Team Member

I was a member of the [USA Junior
National](https://usagym.org/pages/athletes/athleteListDetail.html?id=113855)
team from 2008 - 2013. To become a member of the national team I placed within
the top seven gymnastics of my age group at national championships. Being on the
national team earned me the opportunity to train at week-long training camps at
the USA Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, CO several times a year.

This opportunity also allowed me to represent the United States in three
international competitions in Lilleshall in the UK, Bejjing, China, and
Medell√≠n, Colombia.

### Stanford Men's Gymnastics (September 2012 - April 2015)
During my undergraduate career at Stanford, I was a member of the [Stanford
Men's Gymnastics Team](https://gostanford.com/sports/mens-gymnastics).  I
competed all events except rings, and helped the team to win two second place
and one third place titles at the NCAA championships. Being a gymnast on the
Stanford Men's Gymnastics team required 20 hours of intensive training each week
in addition to weekly competitions across the country during the winter season.
I was a NCAA First Team Academic All-American at the 2013, 2014, and 2015 NCAA
championships, and an Elite 89 Scholar Athlete in 2014.

Unfortunately, during my senior year at Stanford, chronic injuries to my
shoulders and ankles from 15 years of intensive gymnastics prevented me from
competing.

### Trampoline
Of all the things I learned in gymnastics, my favorite by far was bouncing on
the trampoline. I have a compilation of clips on YouTube of me doing trampoline
and some other things.
