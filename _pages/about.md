I'm a software engineer and machine learning researcher at Google X
broadly interested in applied probabilistic ML.

I believe that building robust ML systems requires strong theoretical foundations
in statistics and probabilistic reasoning. I enjoy translating cutting-edge
ML methods into practical applications.

My current interests include Equivariant Euclidian GNNs for molecular modeling,
generative language models in biology, and diffusion/score-based generative
modeling.

I have a background in Bioengineering and Computer Science from Stanford where
I also completed premedical requirements.
 
I was a competitive gymnast for 15 years, an Academic All-American Athlete
on [Stanford Mens Gymnastics](https://gostanford.com/sports/mens-gymnastics)
and represented the Unites States on the [Junior National Team](https://usagym.org/pages/men/history/past_nat_teams_jr.html)
at competitions in China, England, and Colombia.
