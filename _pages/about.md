I'm a senior software engineer and machine learning researcher at X
broadly interested in applied probabilistic ML.

I believe building robust ML systems requires strong theoretical foundations
in statistics and probabilistic reasoning. I enjoy translating cutting-edge
ML methods into practical applications.

My current interests include Equivariant Euclidian GNNs for molecular modeling,
generative language models in biology, and diffusion/score-based generative
modeling.

I have a background in Bioengineering and Computer Science at Stanford where
I also completed premedical requirements.

I was a gymnast for 15 years, competing for [Stanford Mens
Gymnastics](https://gostanford.com/sports/mens-gymnastics) and represented the
Unites States on the [Junior National
Team](https://usagym.org/pages/athletes/athleteListDetail.html?id=113855) at
competitions in China, England, and Colombia.
