In 2018 I started a masters program in computer science at Stanford. This marked
a huge change in career direction towards my passions of computers science,
engineering and reserach rather than previous persuits of medical school.

In my masters program I focused on artifical intelligence and computer systems.
I helped teach courses on Operating Systems and Introduction to Algorithmic Analysis.
