As a personal project I implemented an interpreter for the Lisp programming
language in pure C. The interpreter can be used to run Lisp programs saved in
files, or from an interactive shell. This Lisp interpreter showcases many
features including variable and function declaration, arithmetic operations,
first class/lambda functions, closures, curying, recursive functions, a mutable
global interpreter environment, dynamic scoping, memory allocation and
automatic/deterministic memory management without garbage collection.
