#### October 2016 - March 2017
Heat stroke kills thousands of people annually across the globe. The 2015 Indian
heat wave, for example, resulted in over 2,300 deaths over a two-month period.
To address the need for personalized heat stroke prevention in India, we created
an inexpensive wearable device that measures physiological and environmental
parameters and uses machine learning to determine and inform the user of heat
stroke risk via text message or cell phone application in real time. Our
approach is novel because we are using heat stroke patient data from literature
to inform our algorithms and are determining the parameters most indicative of
heat stroke. We have developed a prediction algorithm and are assembling
relevant sensors and transmitting data. We implemented and tested our system in
high-risk environments to assess accuracy by obtaining sensitivity, specificity,
accuracy, and positive predictive value for our algorithm. We crated
proof-of-concept prototypes to demonstrate viability of a heat stroke prediction
device. Future versions would leverage decreasing costs for wearable sensors
with bluetooth capability.
