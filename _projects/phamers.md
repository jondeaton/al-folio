#### September 2015 - March 2017
Discovering novel phage sequences from metagenomic data is often challenging.
This study presents PhaMers (Phage k-Mers), a phage identification tool that
uses supervised learning to identify metagenomic sequences (contigs) as phage or
non-phage on the basis of tetranucleotide frequencies. PhaMers compares the
tetranucleotide frequencies of metagenomic contigs to those of phage and
bacteria reference genomes from online databases. Using PhaMers, we identified
103 novel phage sequences in hot spring samples from Yellowstone National Park.
We applied a microfluidic-based mini-metagenomic approach to sequence
environmental samples and produce metagenomic sequence datasets. We analyzed
assembled contigs using PhaMers and VirSorter, a publicly available phage
identification and annotation pipeline. We present the performance of PhaMers in
identifying genomic fragments of phages and its ability to predict phage
taxonomic classification. We also present putative hosts and taxa for some novel
phage sequences.
