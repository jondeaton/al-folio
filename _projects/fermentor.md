### January – March 2016
### Team: Jon Deaton, Katie Donahue, Mark Kirollos

In BIOE 123, teams of 2-3 students design and build an E. Coli fermentor. The
fermentor must hold a culture of 200 mL, maintain a temperature of 37 ̊C ± 1 ̊C,
provide adequate aeration and agitation, and display live plots of optical
density for red and green light. In addition, each team conceives of an original
requirement, that their fermentor must also meet. My team used a Raspberry Pi to
allow remote monitoring and control of our fermentor via Wi-Fi. This project was
presented at the 2016 Tau Beta Pi Engineering Showcase at Stanford University.
