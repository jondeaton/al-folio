I'm a researcher at [EvolutionaryScale](https://www.evolutionaryscale.ai/) where I work
on building large-scale foundation models for biology.

I have broad research interests in Machine Learning, primarily motivated by connections
between physics, math and applied machine learning.

I was previously a research scientist
at [Google X](https://x.company) and have a background in Computeer Science and
Bioengineering from Stanford.

I was a gymnast for 15 years, competing for Stanford Mens Gymnastics and represented the
Unites States on the Junior National Team at competitions in China, England, and
Colombia.
