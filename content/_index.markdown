### _Researcher at EvolutionaryScale_

I'm a researcher and engineer at [EvolutionaryScale](https://www.evolutionaryscale.ai/).
My research is motivated by understanding connections between physics and math to
applied machine learning.

I was previously a research scientist
at [Google X](https://x.company) and have degrees in computer science and bioengineering
from Stanford. I was a competitive gymnast for 15 years.
