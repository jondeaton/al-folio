## _Research Scientist at X, the moonshot factory_

I'm a scientist at [X, the moonshot factory](https://x.company) researching machine learning
applications in computational biology. I have a background in computer science
and bioengineering and am broadly interested in machine learning f
learning methods for scientific applications.


I have a background in bioengineering and
computer science and a deep intereste

I believe robust ML systems require theoretical foundations in probabilistic
reasoning and statistics. I enjoy translating cutting-edge ML methods into
practical applications.

My current interests include Equivariant Euclidian GNNs for molecular modeling,
generative language models in biology, and diffusion/score-based generative
modeling.

I have a background in Bioengineering and Computer Science at Stanford where I
also completed premedical requirements.

I was a gymnast for 15 years, competing for Stanford Mens Gymnastics and
represented the Unites States on the Junior National Team at competitions in
China, England, and Colombia.
