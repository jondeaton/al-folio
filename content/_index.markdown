I'm a researcher at [EvolutionaryScale](https://www.evolutionaryscale.ai/) where I work
on building large-scale foundation models for biology.


<!-- I have broad research interests in both theoretical and applied machine learning.  -->
My current research interests include energy based models, extremely long context
language models, and large-scale ML systems for scientific domains such as biology. I
believe that building break-through intelligent systems requires excellence in both
theoretical analysis and in technical research infrastructure.

I was previously a research scientist at [Google X](https://x.company) and have a
background in Computer Science and Bioengineering from Stanford.

I was a [gymnast](https://jondeaton.github.io/gymnastics/) for 15 years, competing for
Stanford Mens Gymnastics and represented the Unites States on the Junior National Team
in international competitions.

I live in San Francisco, California.
