My family uses their laptops a lot, and they tend to get them replaced after
several years. A year ago, I scrounged around our house and rounded up every old
computer that I could find with the hope of putting them together to make some
kind of super computer.

Five old MacBook Pros in hand (some very old), I did some research and
discovered that indeed I could put them to use in what is called a “Beowulf
cluster“. A Beowulf cluster is a collection of computers connected through a
(hopefully fast) network connection so that they can coordinate parallel and
distributed computing tasks. In the next few blog posts, I’ll go into detail
about how I turned a these discarded laptops that would have never been used
again into a cluster that I use for distributed computing.
