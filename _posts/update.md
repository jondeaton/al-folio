I've been wanting to update my personal webpage for quite some time and today finally got around to it.
It has been almost 4 years since I updated it and the task seemed insurmountable because I
originally wrote my personal webpage in raw HTML and CSS. At the time I was 
just starting to get into programming and I just thought that was how websites were generally made. The result
was some incomprehensible mess of poorly formatted HTML that I never wanted to look at again.

Luckilly I found the template [alshedivat/al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) today which made
the task easy and enjoyable.
